# Make your own webthings using MicroBlocks

This repository shows how to program your first web thing using [MicroBlocks](http://microblocks.fun). 
The first example lets you control the built-in LED on a microcontroller board from any browser using 
the [Mozilla Things Gateway](https://iot.mozilla.org). 

More examples will be added over time. Submit your own project example or post ideas and requests 
on the "issues" list.
